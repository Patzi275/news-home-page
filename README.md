## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com)(Just for training xD) - CSS framework
- Mobile-first workflow
- [BEM](https://getbem.com) - A CSS convention

### What I learned

There, i learned how to use grid efficiently with Tailwind and the mobile-first workflow. 
It is something I did without knowing it.

### Continued development

Things that can make this site better are:
- Animation as soon as the page load
- Carousel of main articles
